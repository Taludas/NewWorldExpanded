## How to use

- Either use [iModYourAnno](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases) mod manager or know [how to install mods manually](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno1800-mod-loader#mods).
- If you download the mod manually, use the archive from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Taludas/NewWorldExpanded/releases). Don't download the whole repo! (If you do the latter, you will find yourself with missing island mesh files! -> Invisible islands)

*** WARNING: Do NOT!!! rename the mod folder! Otherwise you will get white island textures all over the new world! ***

**FOR THIS MOD TO WORK PROPERLY YOU NEED TO LOAD/START A NEW SAVE (OR AT LEAST ONE WITHOUT THE NW DISCOVERED)!!! I higly suggest that you use a mod like "Easy seed search" from [Spice it up](https://github.com/anno-mods/Spice-it-Up) for testing before you commit much time into a new playthrough.**

## Changelog
<details>
    <summary>Patch Notes Version 1.2.0</summary>

* Adjustments:
    - In order to keep the file size low, I split the mod into two mods: "Muddy Rivers removed" and "New World Expanded". The first only replaces the NW island's river colour with a blue one. New World Expanded is the main mod, adding the reskinned islands!

* Updates:
    - Adjusted the mod for better usage with iModYourAnno v0.5, default map template used is now "Corners". Fixed the issue with multiple people having a endless loading loop due to faulty iMYA tweaking. No matter what you tweak in iMYA, you will now always get one of the three map templates.

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Patch Notes Version 1.1.0</summary>

* Updates:
    - Update the mod to only use one mod folder instead of the separate installation directories.

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Patch Notes Version 1.0.0</summary>

* Updates:
    - Updated all Island Files to GU16 version.
    - Added Enlarged Map Templates for GU16 (new Savegame required, old map templates won't enlarge themselves to the new ones, but use the old extension)
    - Updated muddy rivers with new Islands from GU16
    - Prepared modularity through iMYA, right now only the map templates are modular, if you want to disable the new islands or don't want muddy rivers, you have to manually edit the assets file right now (remove the <Include> Tags with the appropriate xml-File).

</details>

## New World Expanded: Reskinned Old World Islands for the New World
This module contains 15 reskinned OW islands to use it in the random pool for map generation in the NW for more variety in the session where you normally find all the same islands again and again. The Islands have no new mesh, only the textures and props are replaced to fit the NW. 

Have a look for yourself how good some variety in the NW actually is and what you can think of, maybe a little tropical touristic paradise?

In anticipation of upcomming mods I also integrated functional river slots on them. ~~For now, there are no river buildings, so you can't use them for anything apart from admiring the effort I had to find suitable positions for them.~~ **Fully compatible with my mod [River Slots](https://github.com/Taludas/RiverSlots) which adds 11 new river slot buildings to the OW and NW!**

## New World Expanded: New Map Templates for the NW session
This module contains 3 new map templates for each region size (large, medium, small) which you can choose at game generation.
- Corners: Inspired by OW corners map template with large islands in the corners and small ones in the center of the map.
- Island Arch: Inspired by the OW island arch template with the majority of the islands in the bottom of the map and only some small ones to the north/east.
- Pirates Den: All big islands are located tightly around the pirates slot, so it is quite dangerous to settle and trade there.

## New World Expanded: River Colour
This module only changes the vanilla islands river colour to blue instead of the muddy brown so you can have more of a tropical paradise instead of an Amazonas feeling.
