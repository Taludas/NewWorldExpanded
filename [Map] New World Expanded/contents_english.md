# New World Expanded

This mod enhances the New World map generation with reskinned OW Islands and fresh map templates for more variety and replayability of the game.

***All mods from this archieve need the contents of the "data" folder found within it to be extracted into the Anno 1800 data folder, NOT THE MODS FOLDER!!! You find this folder in the main Anno 1800 directory. Please refer to the picture below.***

***The rest of the folders go into the usual "mods" folder to be loaded by the modloader.***

**FOR THIS MOD TO WORK PROPERLY YOU NEED TO LOAD/START A NEW SAVE (OR AT LEAST ONE WITHOUT THE NW DISCOVERED)!!! I higly suggest that you use a mod like "Easy seed search" from Spice it up for testing before you commit much time into a new playthrough.**

## New World Expanded: Reskinned Old World Islands for the New World
This module contains 15 reskinned OW islands to use it in the random pool for map generation in the NW for more variety in the session where you normally find all the same islands again and again. The Islands have no new mesh, only the textures and props are replaced to fit the NW. 

Have a look for yourself how good some variety in the NW actually is and what you can think of, maybe a little tropical touristic paradies?

In anticipation of upcomming mods I also integrated functional river slots on them. For now, there are no river buildings, so you can't use them for anything apart from admiring the effort I had to find suitable positions for them.

## New World Expanded: New Map Templates for the NW session
This module contains 3 new map templates for each region size (large, medium, small) which you can choose at game generation.
- Corners: Inspired by OW corners map template with large islands in the corners and small ones in the center of the map.
- Island Arch: Inspired by the OW island arch template with the majority of the islands in the bottom of the map and only some small ones to the north/east.
- Pirates Den: All big islands are located tightly around the pirates slot, so it is quite dangerous to settle and trade there.

## New World Expanded: River Colour
This module only changes the vanilla islands river colour to blue instead of the muddy brown so you can have more of a tropical paradies instead of an amazonas feeling.
